# Todo App XState Test

A demonstration todo list application using Vue 3, XState and TailwindCSS.

The purpose of this application is to show how `@xstate/test` can be used to simplify interfaces testing.

While this application is quite simple, there are several different ways to interact with it and we want to ensure all of them work so that users do not discover bugs on their own.

An article about `@xstate/test` will use this application as a sample.

## Credits

The design is heavily inspired by Basecamp todo lists.
